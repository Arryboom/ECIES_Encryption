# ECIES_Encryption
ECIES based encryption algorithm examples. 

In this update I am just copying the base package that I got it from the link: http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-dev@openssl.org/msg28042.html

In the upcoming updates, I will update how we can generate a public private key using openssl and how we can read and use those keys for ECIES based encryption algorithm. Also I will demostrate how we can use this in a client server module.
